# 🐍 30-Day Python Challenge
Hello! I'm Aybars. This project is a series I started to improve myself by learning Python every day for 30 days and applying what I’ve learned to build a tangible project.

# 🎯 Goal
Learn Python programming through real-world applications

Gain practical experience in data collection, processing, and reporting

Develop a habit of using version control with Git and GitHub

Ultimately, create a "Personal Data Collection, Storage, Analysis, and Reporting System"

# 📁 Project Content
A new Python concept every day

File handling (.txt, .csv)

Functions and data structures

Simple analysis (average, maximum, etc.)

Optional data visualization

All developed code will be organized into daily folders

# 🛠 Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Visual Studio Code

Git & GitHub

(Optional) Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenPyXL

# 🧠 Learning Objectives
Day	Topic
1	Introduction, input, and file writing
2	Data structures: list, tuple, dict
3	Functions
4	Loops and conditions
...	...
30	Final project demo and evaluation
# 📝 Contributions & Feedback
Feel free to reach out with any contributions, suggestions, or feedback. This project is open to learning and sharing.

This project is my personal development journey. If you’d like to start your own 30-day challenge, you can fork this repository or get inspired by it!
